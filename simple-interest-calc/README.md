# Simple Interest Calculator (SIC)

## Overview
The Simple Interest Calculator (SIC) is a Python-based program that calculates the simple interest and total amount based on user-provided inputs: principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Features
- Calculates simple interest using the formula:  
   `Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100`

   $$\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100}$$


## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the `sic.py` script using Python:
   ```bash
   python sic.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to input:
   - Principal amount
   - Rate of interest (in %)
   - Time period (in years)
4. View the calculated simple interest and total amount.

## Example
```plaintext
Welcome to SIC!
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the rate of interest (in %): 5
Enter the time (in years): 2
The simple interest is: 100.0
Principal + Simple Interest = 1100.0
```
